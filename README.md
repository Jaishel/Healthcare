Title: HAPPY SAVES



                Introduction
Welcome, fellow advocates of good healthcare, to HAPPY SAVES:  Healthcare Analytics Predicting Possible Yields by Scrutinising And Validating Efficiency, Saving Lives 
                
  Purpose:

HAPPY SAVES aims to use data analytics to uncover opportunities for improving healthcare outcomes and ultimately saving lives. By predicting potential yield changes within a nation’s healthcare system, we empower decision-makers to take informed actions.

  How It Works:
  
We gather data on specific healthcare metrics on various nations.  This data is then plugged into our bespoke Cohorting system, created in Power BI, which allows us to group nations for comparison with similar nations — ones with similar approaches to healthcare universality AND that serve similar ethnic population ranges.

  Highlighting Outliers:
  
We identify healthcare systems that are highly efficient in delivering positive outcomes (measured in terms of outcome per USD spent).
  Conversely, we pinpoint systems that are highly inefficient.

  Impact:
If your nation falls into either category, you’ll at minimum have an opportunity to advocate for data cleansing within your health governance system, OR likelier, you'll have an extremely powerful case to alter your healthcare system or even your government's approach to a particular substance, lifestyle or environmental practice. 

Valid data provides a chance to make impactful decisions and save lives.
