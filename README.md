Title: HAPPY SAVES

                Introduction
Welcome, fellow advocates of good healthcare, to HAPPY SAVES!

The purpoose of the Healthcare Analytics Predicting Possible Yields by Scrutinising And Validating Efficiency Saves Lives (HAPPY SAVES), is, simply, to use data to expose opportunities to save lives.  To predict possible yields of changes that could be made to a nation's healthcare system, by comparing it with similar, nearby healthcare systems that cater to similar, nearby populations. 

How does it work?  

The project takes data about a given healthcare metric for a nation or nations, in the published example, Deaths By Alcohol Use Disorder, compares it with those of other similar nations, ie those that have both similar approaches to universality of healthcare, AND similar ethnic ranges of population served, and highlights those outliers who systems might either:  

 1) Be highly efficient in delivering good healthcare outcomes for a given healthcare metric;
 2) Be highly INefficient in the same.

If your nation of concern falls in either category, you will have, at worst, an opportunity to make a case to the nation's health governance system, to cleanse the data.  If the data is not faulty, you have an opportunity to save lives.
